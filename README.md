## Deprecated.

I'm not maintaining this anymore but [dgraziotin's fork](https://github.com/dgraziotin/mbpfan) is quite active. Go there :)

## Old Readme:

This is a daemon that uses input from coretemp module and sets the fan speed using the applesmc module. It includes a PKGBUILD for easy installation in Arch Linux.
